# Small Side Projects

This repository contains a bunch of projects I made as fun side projects. Most are made using just simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## Gravity (gravity.html)

Project to simulate the interaction of masses in space. I programmed the laws of gravity and momentum to displace the different masses on the screen and have them collide. (Note: click anywhere on screen to add a new mass.)

## Image editor (img_editor.html)

In this project, I just wanted to play around with programming an image editor / paint equivalent for mac that works directly in a browser.

## Lines (lines.html)

After making the π project, I wanted to keep working with a similar idea. This project fills the screen with random lines of random color.

## π (pi.html)

After being inspired from a similar art piece, I wanted to make a program that broke down the digits of π into colors (each number 0-9 has its own color). A line is then added between the colors of two consecutive digits, to make this cool looking design.

## Pong (pong.html)

A very basic game of pong. The paddles move with s/w and the up/down keys.

## War (war.html)

This simulation starts with a square divided evenly between green and purple. Each 'round', if two pixels of different color are next to each, they 'fight' (a winner is randomly decided), and whichever one wins turns the other pixel into its own color. The simulation goes on until the whole square is covered in only one color.
